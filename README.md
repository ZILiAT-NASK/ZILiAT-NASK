## About Us
The Linguistic Engineering and Text Analysis Department is dedicated to exploring and harnessing the power of language in various applications. Our team of linguists, data scientists, and software engineers work together to develop innovative solutions for text analysis, information extraction, summarization, text classification, and much more. 📚🧠💻

## Projects
1. [Polish Dataset of Banned Harmful and Offensive Content from Wykop.pl web service](https://github.com/ZILiAT-NASK/BAN-PL/tree/main)

2. [StyloMetrix](https://github.com/ZILiAT-NASK/StyloMetrix) s a powerful tool that enables the creation of text representations in the form of StyloMetrix vectors. Each metric in the vector quantifies a specific linguistic feature, allowing for a detailed analysis of the text's style through numeric values. With the ability to customize metrics, StyloMetrix is a versatile solution for tasks such as stylometric analysis, machine learning classifiers, statistical analyses, and linguistic reference. Available for Polish, English, and Ukrainian.

3. [Summarizer](https://github.com/ZILiAT-NASK/Summarizer) is an innovative tool designed for generating concise and informative summaries of text documents. Using advanced natural language processing techniques, Summarizer distills the key points and main ideas from lengthy texts into coherent summaries.

4. [PrivMasker](https://github.com/ZILiAT-NASK/PrivMasker) is a tool for anonymizing personal and sensitive data in documents. Depending on the text type and user preferences, an optional selection of masked components is available, including names, contact details (phone numbers, email addresses), physical addresses, dates, identification numbers, and monetary amounts. 

## Research Papers
Our department actively contributes to the scientific community through research papers published in top-tier conferences and journals. Some of our recent papers include:

- "Styles with Benefits. The StyloMetrix Vectors for Stylistic and Semantic Text Classification of Small-Scale Datasets and Different Sample Length" - Published at PPRAI 2022. You can find the paper [here](). 📝🔬🌐
- "The Grammar and Syntax Based Corpus Analysis Tool For The Ukrainian Language". Access the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13530.pdf). 📝🔎🔄
- "Team Up! Cohesive Text Summarization Scoring Sentence Coalitions" - Published at ICAISC 2020. You can find the paper [here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Inez-Okulska/publication/344865487_Team_up_Cohesive_Text_Summarization_Scoring_Sentence_Coalitions/links/5f949ba992851c14bce559a6/Team-up-Cohesive-Text-Summarization-Scoring-Sentence-Coalitions.pdf). 📝🔬🌐
